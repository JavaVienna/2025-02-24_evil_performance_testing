# Kickstart Your Gatling Performance Testing

You think of using Gatling to run performance test? But got confused with Scala, DSL and documentation? 

This presentation shows how to write Gatling tests in your IDE, execute them on the command line and push them into your CI server of choice. Afterwards we discuss a few of Gatlingâ€™s feature such as 

* Injection profiles
* Scenario implementation
* Test configuration 
* Last but not least debugging your Gatling scripts.
